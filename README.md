### SUMMARY

The tree-based scan statistic is one of the several data mining methods to detect signals of adverse drug events for a database of spontaneous reporting system. In the tree-based scan statistic, the unconditional Bernoulli scan statistic can be used to detect signals for matched case-control data. However, this statistic does not properly reflect the dependency within a matched pair. In this article, we propose test statistics for signal detection on matched case-control data based on the McNemarâ€™s test, the Wald test for the conditional logistic regression, and the likelihood ratio test for a multinomial distribution. Through simulation studies, we have demonstrated that our proposed methods have better performance for the type I error rate, power, sensitivity, and false detection rate than the existing method. We also illustrate the proposed methods using the database of Korea adverse event reporting system to compare the case-control drug pair for the Atorvastatin and Rosuvastatin.
